Human performance is _product_ of capacity components (time × quality × absorption × biological state). A zero or near-zero in any core dimension should collapse velocity; multiplicative structure enforces that. The following is one way to measure it (taking into account measurable parameters that can be correlated thus tied with real productivity with a medium to high confidence level):
